# Stub type inference

*Input*: the corpus and some sort of mapping file from ontology concepts to type annotations. Later, we also need the discuss if or how we can connect this to the corpus directly because we want to run this in a loop.

*Output*: type annotations for the corpus as .jaif files. We have to discuss how we can extend petablox/LB to accept .jaif files.

**TODO:** run.sh currently only downloads the checker-framework stuff and runs the regression tests. We still have to work on a proper integration.
